## GL4 - Labs of our Software Testing class
This repository contains some basic Java code (simple examples of Java classes with their respective test classes) on which I used Maven and JUnit4 to get introduced to hands-on software testing. <br> The whole project consists of two labs, for each you'll find a folder under the */src/main/java/* hierarchy. There are also corresponding folders for the test classes under */src/test/java* so you can follow the examples smoothly.
<br> All tests should pass so if you got into trouble, it's probably a local issue on your side :/  Good luck!
